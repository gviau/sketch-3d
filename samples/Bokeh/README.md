Bokeh Sample
============

This sample implements PCF shadowing, HDR and bloom lighting, normal mapping and spherical harmonics irradiance.

This sample also implements bokeh. The implementation follows what is described at
https://mynameismjp.wordpress.com/2011/02/28/bokeh/.

All the models and textures come also from the same source and are not mine.
