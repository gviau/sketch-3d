Burning Paper Sample
====================

This sample shows a simple burning paper animation.

It uses a noise texture and discards the pixel of the paper surface when a certain thershold value has
been reached. Moreover, if the noise texture is between a small range of the threshold, it will give
a redish color to the paper surface in that region, so that it looks like it is burning.
