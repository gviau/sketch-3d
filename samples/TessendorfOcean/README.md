Tessendorf Ocean Sample
=======================

This sample implemnts an ocean simulation as described by the Tessendorf 2001 paper.

It creates a flat subdivided surface and do a FFT on all the points of the surface to compute the
height, the normal and the displacement vector in the XZ plane of the vertices.
