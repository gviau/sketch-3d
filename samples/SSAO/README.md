SSAO Sample
===========

This sample implements SSAO as implemented in http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.ca/2013/01/ssao-tutorial.html

It shows SSAO applied to a fairly complex Mesh. The user can turn on/off SSAO by pressing 1 or 0, respectively.
Also, the user can change the radius of the hemisphere used to compute SSAO with the up and down arrow keys.
