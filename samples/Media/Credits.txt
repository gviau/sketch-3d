The hellknight models, textures and animations are taken from the Doom 3 game. I hace no copyrights on those assets and only use them for this personnal project and not for a commercial one. idSoftware retains full
rights on those assets. Thumbs up to them.

The only modification that I made was to remove the gob and gob2 mesh from the original mesh.
