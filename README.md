sketch-3d
=========

A simple cross-platform 3D renderer. This is a learning experience project.

To build the library, the samples and the test, you need the following CMake to create the appropriate files for compilation.

You need the following libraries:
* Assimp
* Boost (unit\_test\_framework)
* FreeImage
* OpenGL

And optionally:
* OIS

Then you need to follow these steps:
1. Create a folder where you will put the files generated by CMake (such as ./build)
2. Go in this folder and run the following command: cmake ../. -G"Generator Name" where the relative path "../." points to the root folder of the git repository nad "Generator Name" is the name of a generator accepted by CMake which you will use to generate the binaries.
